# Used Car Price Prediction
When you are selling a vehicle online, finding the right price for a vehicle is always a hassle. 
The goal of the project is to predict the price of used cars and determine whether they can be sold as a whole or just for their parts. Valuation of used cars is tricky as it not only depends on the specifications of the car but also on the current state of the car.  

The price of a used car depends on attributes such as odometer reading, fuel type, years of use, wear, etc. The aim of the project is to efficiently and reliably calculate the price. Based on this valuation and the actual price of the car, the system will then decide whether it is better to sell the whole car or sell the car in parts.
